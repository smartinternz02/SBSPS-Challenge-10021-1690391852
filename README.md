## What is Evian?
It is a one stop solution to all your EV Charging Problem. It will significantly impact user's time and effort. Instead of finding EV stations and empty slots physically, You can now explore various stations, compare prices and book slots from home.

## What's our Motive?

<ul>
<li>Electric Vehicles have revolutionized the automobile industry. A large portion of the automobile will be replaced by EVs in the near future
</li>
<li>
The number of users using EVs is increasing rapidly, and so are the investments made in this sector. The global EV sales grew by 43% from 2019 and the global electric car industry market share rose to a record 4,6% in 2020.
</li>
<li>
It will come with some issues. Because EV charging takes longer, consumers will have to wait in queues for recharge. This would be a waste of the user's time. 
</li>
<li>
But we have a solution: what if a user could reserve a slot for recharging from home? What if customers could obtain a list of local charging stations and their available slots? 
Here comes Evians, where users can schedule charging spaces, check available stations, and book slots accordingly.

</ul>
